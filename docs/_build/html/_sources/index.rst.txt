The COMET is a pyhon framework for a dialogue system that follow the stanrdard dialogue system architectures. Aiming to quickly set up experiments with reusable components and compare large set of difference approaches, easily to create, train, evaluate and deploy tasked-oriented dialogue systems.
The conversational agent architectures can interacting with human users and with simulated users, respectively. Interacting with simulated users is a common practice used in the research community to jump-start learning
