Dialogue state tracker
""""""""""""""""""""""

The first one is state tracking and it actually acquires some hand-crafted states. And, what it
does is, it can query the external database or knowledge base for some additional information. It
actually tracks the evolving state of the dialogue and it constructs the state estimation after every
utterance from the user.
