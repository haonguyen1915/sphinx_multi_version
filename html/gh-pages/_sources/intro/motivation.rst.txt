Motivation
==========

Rasa is the best choice when we just dig into making conversational AI systems productions because Rasa provides a strong infrastructure and tools for quick development by minimizing code for engineering and abstracting the complexity of AI algorithms. However, from the perspective of AI practitioners and AI researchers, Rasa’s pipeline might not be easily mapped with the typical dialogue system that existed in academic research. Consequently, it’s a challenge to apply the latest research to boost performance of each AI component as well as the whole dialogue system because it requires many engineering efforts to customize or even modify Rasa’s architecture.

To overcome these obstacles, we aim to build a new platform (CAIS) that could be a combination of the advantage of both research and production platforms. In specific, our platform has following characteristics which make it become the best-fit for building task-oriented dialogue systems:

- The platform’s pipeline is implemented to mainly serve the domain of conversational AI systems.
- The platform’s architecture is designed to easily integrate advanced AI research. For example, building an user simulator towards the purpose of training dialogue policy online with reinforcement learning algorithms.

Scope
=====

Comet is focusing on making task-oriented dialogue systems. So that most of our implementation, pipeline and design are dedicated to serve this domain.
So what is the task-oriented dialog systems
