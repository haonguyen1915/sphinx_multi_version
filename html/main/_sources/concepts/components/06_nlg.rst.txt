Natural language generator(NLG)
-------------------------------

Natural Language Generation, as defined by Artificial Intelligence: Natural Language Processing Fundamentals,
is the “process of producing meaningful phrases and sentences in the form of natural language.”

In other words, structured data is presented in an unstructured manner to the user. Think of NLG is
the inverse of NLU.

With NLU we are taking the unstructured conversational input from the user (natural language) and
structuring it for our software process. With NLG, we are taking structured data from backend and
state machines, and turning this into unstructured data. Conversational output in human language.

- NLU takes up the understanding of the data based on grammar, the context in which it was said and decide on intent and entities.
- DM converts a text into structured data.
- NLG generates a text based on structured data.
