Step 2: Custom the Dialogue State (Optional)
============================================

Dialogue State we are explained further in :ref:`Dialogue State Section <dialogue_state>`.

Comet already implemented :class:`Dialogue State <comet.agent.core.state.DialogueState>`. You can visit to all attribute of this ``Class``.

If you want to customize the Dialogue State, you can inherits from :class:`Dialogue State <comet.agent.core.state.State>`

In this example we use :class:`Dialogue State <comet.agent.core.state.DialogueState>` without customize for this domain.
